# Email & Cron Management Setup

This document explains how to set up the automated email notification system for orders.

## Features

- **Order Confirmation Emails**: Sent immediately when an order is created
- **Order Processing Emails**: Sent when order status changes to "processing"
- **Order Delivered Emails**: Sent when order status changes to "delivered"
- **Cron Job Management**: Automated email processing with manual triggers
- **Beautiful Email Templates**: Professional HTML emails with Barvella branding

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
```

## Gmail Setup (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

## Cron Job Schedule

- **Order Confirmation**: Every 5 minutes (checks for pending orders)
- **Order Processing**: Every 10 minutes (checks for processing orders)
- **Order Delivered**: Every 15 minutes (checks for delivered orders)
- **Daily Cleanup**: Every day at 2 AM

## API Endpoints

### Admin Only (requires authentication)

- `GET /api/cron/status` - Get cron job status
- `POST /api/cron/start` - Start all cron jobs
- `POST /api/cron/stop` - Stop all cron jobs
- `GET /api/cron/email-config` - Check email configuration
- `POST /api/cron/trigger/confirmation` - Manually trigger confirmation emails
- `POST /api/cron/trigger/processing` - Manually trigger processing emails
- `POST /api/cron/trigger/delivered` - Manually trigger delivered emails

## Email Templates

### Order Confirmation

- Sent immediately when order is created
- Includes order details, shipping address, and items
- Professional Barvella branding

### Order Processing

- Sent when order status changes to "processing"
- Explains what's happening with the order
- Builds customer confidence

### Order Delivered

- Sent when order status changes to "delivered"
- Includes next steps and quality guarantee
- Encourages reviews and future purchases

## Database Changes

The Order model now includes:

```javascript
emailSent: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['confirmation', 'processing', 'delivered', null],
  default: null
}
```

## Testing

1. **Create a test order** and check for immediate confirmation email
2. **Update order status** to "processing" and check for processing email
3. **Update order status** to "delivered" and check for delivered email
4. **Use manual triggers** to test email sending without waiting for cron jobs

## Troubleshooting

### Emails not sending

1. Check email credentials in `.env`
2. Verify Gmail app password is correct
3. Check server logs for email errors
4. Ensure `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are set

### Cron jobs not running

1. Check server logs for cron initialization
2. Verify timezone settings (Asia/Dhaka)
3. Use manual triggers to test email functionality
4. Check cron job status via API

### Email template issues

1. Check browser console for HTML rendering
2. Verify email client compatibility
3. Test with different email providers

## Security Notes

- Email credentials are stored in environment variables
- All cron endpoints require admin authentication
- Email sending failures don't affect order processing
- App passwords are recommended over regular passwords

## Monitoring

Monitor the system through:

- Server logs (email sending status)
- Cron job status API
- Email configuration API
- Database emailSent field tracking
